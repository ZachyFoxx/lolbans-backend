![Master](https://github.com/NotZachery/LolBans-API/workflows/Master/badge.svg)

TypeScript API backend for LolBans.

## Configuration

```env

# How long the statistics cache should last.
API_CACHE_LIFETIME=5

# Database Configuration
TYPEORM_CONNECTION=mysql
TYPEORM_HOST=localhost

# potential side effects.
TYPEORM_SYNCHRONIZE=true

TYPEORM_LOGGING=true

```

## Running

### Development

By default, the API will try to load variables stored in `.env`. It will fall back to process environment if this fails.

```bash
$ yarn
// bla bla bla
$ yarn start
```

### Production

For production, a Dockerfile is provided for building an image of the API. The environment variables listed above can then be passed to the container.

## Routes

### GET /

Utility route to check the API is alive - returns the current version ;3

### GET /punishments?page=1

Return an array of all punishments, ordered by date of creation. Limited to 100 per request, support pagination.

**Query Params**

-   `page` - The page of infractions to retrieve. Will return error 401 if not a positive integer.

### GET /punishments/:id

Return the punishment with the specified ID. Supports both sequential numeric, and LolBans Punishment ID as a request parameter.

### GET /users/:uuid

Return the details of the user with the given UUID.

### GET /statistics

Returns detailed statistics concerning all punishments. **This endpoint is cached** - it will only update every 5 minutes (by default). This value can be changed in the environment configuration.

## GET /statistics/timed

Fetches punishment counts over a period of time, grouped by days.

**Query Params**

-   `start` - The first dates to retrieve. **Default:** One week ago
-   `end` - The last date to retrieve. **Default:** Now

Both times are JavaScript timestamps (time since 1970 in milliseconds, or Unix timestamp \* 1000).

**Example Response**

```json
